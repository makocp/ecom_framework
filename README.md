## Description
The aim of this project, is to build an e-commerce application with a functional payment system. The focus is on the core functionalities (order process incl. payment). After this is done, additional functionalities like cart, better UI design, detailed product view, etc. can be implemented.

My personal motivation here is to learn about React Native, TypeScript and also dive deeper into e-commerce.

Also, this app can be used as "framework" for an e-commerce app. The base is already here, just a few configurations like product import, adaption of design, etc. has to be done.
